# H-M_churn_prediction_and_customer_segmentation
Using H&amp;M public dataset on Kaggle to implement Churn Prediction and Customer Segmentation models


## About the project

This project is the final assignment for the Strategy & Performance Management class in our Master of Applied Data Science program at Frankfurt School.
Inspired by the H&M dataset in a Kaggle competition ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations)), we want to build a Churn Prediction and Customer Segmentation model out of the transaction and customer data from Septerber 2018 to September 2020.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data).    
3. Data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis scripts are stored in "EDA" folder.
4. Data model scripts are stored in "Models" folder.
5. Visualizations created for the presentation are stored in the "tableau_dahsboard" folder in the form of a tableau file (.twb). The packaged tableau file (.twbx) was too large to upload to git, so the .twb file has been uploaded instead. Please connect the output csv from the Customer Segmentation model to this Tableau file to be able to see the visualizations. If anything, please contact MyThu Lam at thu.lam@fs-students.de for help.
