# H-M_churn_prediction_and_customer_segmentation
Using H&amp;M public dataset on Kaggle to implement Churn Prediction and Customer Segmentation models


## About the project

This project is the final assignment in Strategic & Performance Management class in our Master of Data Science programe in Frankfurt School.
Inspired by the H&M dataset in a Kaggle competition (link), we want to build a Churn Prediction and Customer Segmentation model out of the transaction and customer data from Septerber 2018 to September 2020.
